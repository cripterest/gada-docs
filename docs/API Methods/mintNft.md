The `mintNft` method converts an existing `utility` on the Gada SDK to an actual `NFT` deployable to the blockchain. When you mint a utility, you're simply preparing the utility for deployment to the blockchain. The process can take a few minutes depending on the communication between the `Solana` blockchain and the Gada SDK itself.

:::warning
This is a blockchain method that performs minting on block chain.
