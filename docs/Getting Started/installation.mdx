# Getting Started
To get started using the **Gada API**, visit the Gada [dashboard](https://dashboard.gadalabs.com), create an account, and generate your personal `API keys`. You can now use the API keys to start marking requests.

### Authentication

| Security Scheme Type            | apiKeyId     |
|---------------------------------|--------------|
| Header parameter name           | apiKeySecret |

### Requirements
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or any other `API` testing application of your choice.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client.

### Making a request

Every request to the Gada API are post request, you must supply your API keys to the `auth` param every time you make a request. To make a request with the `getUtilities` add the code block below to the `body` section of postman and set the request-URL to Â [api.gadalabs.com](https://api.gadalabs.com).

```json
  {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getUtilities",
  "params": {
    "auth": {
      "apiKeyId": "your_api_Key_Id",
      "apiKeySecret": "your_api_Key_Secret"
    },
  },
  "id": 1
}
```
